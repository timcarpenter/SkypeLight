# SkypeLight
A program for showing the actual "Skype for Business"/ Lync status with an external hardware.
The external hardware is an arduino nano v3 with a adafruit neopixel jewel (https://www.adafruit.com/products/2226) and a tm1631 display 
(like this: http://www.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Grove_-_4-Digit_Display)
The jewel is coverd with a translucent cube.
The data exchange is very simple, using the USB-COM port driver of the arduino nano.
